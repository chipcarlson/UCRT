# UCRT
This is the Nuix Universal Case Reporting Tool
Introduction
The Nuix Universal Case Reporting Tool (URC) is intended to allow Nuix users to gain insight into various statistical 
case information and cross case search-term hit reports. The UCR tool will extract vital data from across one or more directories 
containing Nuix cases.  Once the case data is collected, the data will be stored in a SQLite database for continued use and 
statistical analysis.

The Nuix UCR tool will give valuable insight into how an organization utilizes Nuix in their environment.  
This tool will help them evaluate how to understand the data that they are indexing and how to process data most 
effectively going forward.
